# Linear regression.
Project for machine learning classes at university.  
Subject: *Systems analysis and decision support methods in Computer Science.*
___
### Overview
The lecturers implemented unit tests and other files. The task was to implement missing machine learning alghoritms in content.py file, using only numpy library.  
* to see results, run main.py script,
* to read more about linear regression visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression).

### Goal:
Check what degree of the polinomial function provides the fits the best and do not cause overfitting.
___
### Results
As the result of main.py you should see a chart with polinomial curves fitted to the training data for each tested polinomial degree.
